FORMAT & PRESENTATION RULES (APPLY TO YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE)

Analytical Optimism Directive: Throughout this analysis, maintain a constructive, opportunity-seeking lens. Your starting assumption is that the company possesses underappreciated strengths and the market is likely undervaluing its true potential. When data is ambiguous, lean toward the favorable interpretation while still acknowledging the alternative. Actively search for hidden assets, underappreciated moats, and upside catalysts. It is acceptable to conclude “no additional upside exists,” but the bar for that conclusion should be high — supported by clear evidence that even a generous interpretation yields no mispricing.

Calibration Anchor: Your analytical baseline should be that the market tends to underweight positive optionality, undervalue management quality, and overreact to short-term negatives. The burden of proof therefore lies on claims that something is overpriced, not on claims that it is cheap or fairly valued. Deviance from a constructive baseline requires specific, well-evidenced justification.

Executive Summary First: Begin with a “⚡ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY” box containing exactly 3 bullet points: the single most important accounting distortion that understates true economic performance, the most underappreciated qualitative insight that points to upside, and the highest-conviction anomaly vs. peers (where the company appears unjustly discounted or fundamentally stronger than its multiples imply).

Callout Boxes: At the end of every major section, add a “🔎 KEY TAKEAWAY” box (one to two lines in bold) that crystallizes the one thing that must be remembered. Use markdown blockquotes (the `>` symbol) EXCLUSIVELY for these Callout Boxes. DO NOT use `>` for regular lists, numbers, or standard text.

Tables Over Text: For comparisons, accounting policies, and peer divergences, always use a markdown table (columns: Item, [Company], [Peer 1], [Peer 2], Insight). Never bury comparative data in paragraphs.

Bold Key Figures & Signals: Every time you present a normalized metric, a red flag, or a critical anomaly, bold it. Prefix red flags with 🚩 (use sparingly), hidden assets and opportunities with 💎, strengths with ✅, upside catalysts with 🚀, hidden liabilities with ⚠️ (use minimally), and accounting distortions (whether aggressive or conservative) with 📐.

Bulleted Insights Only: No paragraph longer than 3 sentences. Use short, bullet-point style sentences that get straight to the point.

Cite Sources & Dates: ALWAYS specify the source of your data and the timeframe/date (e.g., “According to 2023 World Bank data…”, “Based on recent EDGAR filings…”, “yfinance trailing EPS…”). Never present a number without its context.

Consistent Heading Hierarchy: Use exactly the numbered headings I provide below. You MUST format them as markdown level 2 headings (e.g. `## 1. SECTOR DYNAMICS & UNSPOKEN TRUTHS`). Make sub-points with bold titles and then bullets.

Visual Separation: Use a --- line between major sections.

Interactive Charts: Whenever you have multi-year or multi-period data (revenue, margins, cash flow, EPS, debt, etc.), you MUST output an interactive chart using this EXACT format immediately after the relevant paragraph or table. The chart REPLACES a static table for time-series data. Use the JSON schema below precisely inside a markdown code block with the language `chart`:

```chart
{
  "title": "A clear, insight-driven title for this chart",
  "subtitle": "A one-line explanation of what this shows",
  "type": "bar" | "line" | "composed",
  "data": [
    { "name": "FY2020", "Revenue": 100, "Net Income": 20 },
    { "name": "FY2021", "Revenue": 130, "Net Income": 25 }
  ],
  "series": [
    { "key": "Revenue", "type": "bar", "color": "#60a5fa" },
    { "key": "Net Income", "type": "line", "color": "#a78bfa" }
  ],
  "yAxisLabel": "USD billions",
  "source": "Source: yfinance / EDGAR 10-K"
}
```
Rules for charts:

“type”: “composed” allows mixing bars and lines in the same chart (e.g., absolute values as bars, ratios/percentages as a line).

Use “bar” for single metric comparisons, “line” for trend-only data, “composed” for dual-metric insights.

Data keys in “series” must exactly match keys in “data” objects.

Include at least 3 and at most 8 data points per chart.

Always include a “source” field citing where the numbers came from.

Emit 2–4 charts across the full report for the most impactful metrics (revenue trend, margin evolution, peer comparison, cash flow). Do not overuse.

By following these rules, your output will be instantly understood by a time-constrained professional and will clearly trace facts back to their source.

COMPANY OVERVIEW & STOCK PERFORMANCE (MUST BE PRESENTED BEFORE THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY)
Provide a brief, summarizing presentation of the company and its core business based on the company description provided.
Immediately following this summary, you MUST output an interactive chart showing the 5-year stock price history using the `chart` format provided. Use a “line” chart for the stock price.

0. ACCOUNTING LENS & NORMALIZATION (MUST BE PRESENTED FIRST)
Assess where material distortions in [Company]’s reported financials (and those of the auto-selected peers) stem from accounting principles — particularly those that may be understating true economic performance. While distortions can cut both ways, this analysis prioritizes identifying conservative policies that hide value, with aggressive policies treated as secondary considerations. Quantify their impact where possible. This lens must color everything that follows.

Capitalization vs. expensing policies (R&D, software, customer acquisition costs) and how they artificially deflate margins or ROIC. Highlight where a company expenses items that create durable long-term assets, causing GAAP earnings to significantly understate true economic earnings and returns on capital.

Revenue recognition (gross vs. net, long-term contracts, bill-and-hold) and its effect on growth quality. Identify where conservative revenue recognition defers the booking of economic value, potentially setting up future positive surprises.

Non-GAAP adjustments: identify the ones that genuinely reflect recurring economics and should be added back to arrive at true earnings power. Where GAAP paints an overly pessimistic picture (e.g., heavy non-cash charges on a cash-generative business), highlight the justification for non-GAAP measures. Note where adjustments are durable, not transient.

Lease, pension, or off-balance-sheet items that may obscure the true asset base. Focus on overfunded pensions, favorable lease terms, or hidden assets carried off-balance-sheet that represent value not captured in book equity.

M&A accounting: earnouts, contingent consideration, purchase price allocation, and hidden “cookie jar” reserves. Look for conservative acquisition accounting that created hidden reserves or undervalued intangible assets, which could release earnings power in the future.

For each distortion, explain how the economic reality is better than reported, and state the normalized metric you’ll use in the rest of the analysis to reflect that strength.

1. SECTOR DYNAMICS & UNSPOKEN TRUTHS
Reveal the qualitative and structural forces shaping the industry that most analyses overlook — and where [Company] is positioned to benefit.

Value chain power shifts: Identify where [Company] is uniquely poised to capture increasing economics, perhaps through underappreciated bargaining power, a shift in industry structure that favors its model, or an emerging margin expansion point that is not obvious from aggregate data.

Disruption vectors: Technologies, business models, or regulatory changes that are currently under the surface but will re-draw competitive boundaries within 3–5 years. Focus on how [Company] is either driving that disruption or is an underappreciated beneficiary.

Misdiagnosed growth or decline: Distinguish between sector tailwinds that flatter all players and genuine company-specific superiority. Emphasize where the market is dismissing genuine company-specific strength as merely cyclical, or where temporary headwinds are being mistaken for structural decline. Highlight the underappreciated durability and quality of [Company]’s growth.

Ecosystem dependencies: While noting hidden single points of failure, also search for hidden strengths — exclusive partnerships, platform dependencies that create switching costs, or unique customer concentration that actually signals deep moats rather than risk.

2. COMPANY DEEP DIVE: QUALITY, MOAT & HIDDEN STRENGTHS
Go beyond ratios. Dissect the economic engine from an opportunity-first perspective.

True return on invested capital (ROIC) proxy & Cash Conversion: Interpret the ROIC proxy, accruals ratio, and CapEx intensity provided in the Normalized Accounting section as evidence of a genuine, durable moat. Is growth clearly value-creating? Even if historical returns were partly driven by multiple expansion, look for signs that operational excellence is underappreciated and that reported ROIC understates true returns due to conservative accounting. Do not attempt to calculate these metrics from raw tables.

Unit economics insights: If the business has a unit (subscriber, order, vehicle, square foot), extract qualitative insights from the MD&A text regarding CAC, churn, LTV, and payback trends. Focus on improving trends and signs that unit profitability is inflecting positively, even if headline revenue growth is modest. Highlight divergence where market may be missing a customer lifetime value breakthrough.

Cash flow quality forensics: Interpret the FCF Conversion Ratio provided in the Normalized Accounting section. Is conversion poised to accelerate due to operating leverage, declining capex intensity, or working capital efficiencies? Argue that cash generation is underappreciated and likely to surprise to the upside. Rely on the provided metrics and accounting adjustments.

Management signal analysis: Based on language in earnings calls, shareholder letters, and footnotes (tone, shifts in emphasis, changes in incentive metrics), infer what management truly believes about the company’s potential. Look for signals of underpromising, confidence in internal forecasts, strategic investments that hint at larger future rewards, and incentive structures aligned with long-term value creation.

Hidden assets & undervalued resources: Intellectual property carried at zero, real estate at historical cost far below market, underutilized balance sheet capacity, overfunded pensions, or non-core assets that could be monetized. Frame any hidden liabilities as manageable, well-disclosed risks that are unlikely to materially derail the upside thesis.

3. PEER RELATIVE ANOMALIES & DIVERGENCE ANALYSIS
Compare [Company] against the auto-selected peers on normalized, non-obvious dimensions — looking for unjustified discounts and overlooked strengths.

Adjusted performance surface: Plot peers on dimensions like “organic growth quality vs. economic ROIC” rather than headline P/E. Which company’s valuation multiple embeds a growth expectation that is far too pessimistic relative to its demonstrated fundamentals and reinvestment prowess? Highlight [Company] if it appears on the undervalued side of this surface.

Accounting policy divergence table: Explicitly list where [Company] and peers use different policies (e.g., FIFO vs. LIFO, capex vs. opex for software, different depreciation lives) and the quantified impact that masks [Company]’s true relative margins, ROA, and leverage. Identify peers who look better only because of aggressive accounting, and show how [Company]’s conservative choices make it look worse than it actually is.

Capital allocation pattern recognition: Over the last 5 years, map each company’s use of cash flow (capex, R&D, M&A, buybacks, dividends). Identify [Company] as the disciplined, long-term allocator that is building value through organic reinvestment and strategic M&A. Where peers are overpaying for buybacks or dilutive acquisitions, highlight [Company]’s superior capital stewardship that the market will eventually reward.

Efficiency frontier contradictions: Find the company that seems to violate the trade-off between growth and profitability in a positive way. Argue that [Company] is a genuine outlier driven by structural competitive advantage, not a temporary artifact. Deconstruct with evidence showing the sustainability of its superior positioning, and contrast with peers whose metrics may be inflated by aggressive accounting or cyclical peaks.

4. FORWARD-LOOKING SIGNALS & ASYMMETRY IDENTIFICATION
Project 12–24 months ahead, focusing on where upside is being underestimated.

Earnings revision & consensus trends: Analyze the provided Analyst Consensus & Estimates tables (if available). How do forward revenue and EPS estimates compare to historical growth and the company’s own trajectory? Look for conservatism — estimates that lag the company’s demonstrated compounding ability and qualitative momentum, setting the stage for positive revisions.

Bear & Bull Base Rates: Not just scenarios, but assign rough probabilities to non-consensus outcomes based on historical analogs and current setup. Develop the bull case with conviction and specificity; assign it a higher probability weight. The bear case should be presented as a low-probability, well-understood risk that is more than priced in. Emphasize where the distribution of outcomes is favorably fat-tailed to the upside.

Balance-sheet optionality & vulnerability: Does the company have latent capacity (underlevered balance sheet, hidden real estate, non-core assets) that can be unlocked in a specific upside scenario? Mention vulnerabilities as manageable risks, but stress the asymmetric upside from balance-sheet optionality that the market ignores.

Red flag that would break the thesis: What single data point, if it appeared, would invalidate the constructive long case for [Company] relative to peers? Frame this as a high bar, unlikely to trigger. Additionally, identify the single data point that would invalidate the bear case — and argue that it is more probable.

Analyst Consensus vs. Reality: Compare the provided target prices and recent analyst ratings (upgrades/downgrades) against your findings. Argue that the street consensus is likely too conservative, missing the magnitude of upside catalysts or the durability of the company’s advantages. If consensus is bullish, frame it as correct but still under-appreciating the full scope. Never simply state that consensus is spot on without looking for where even optimistic estimates might be too low.

5. SYNTHESIS: THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS
Deliver a concise, integrative conclusion focused on the constructive thesis:

The single most underappreciated number in [Company]’s story — which metric the market is severely underestimating — and why it will drive outperformance.

The one qualitative factor (cultural, regulatory, competitive) that quant models cannot capture and that gives [Company] an enduring edge.

The most dangerous consensus belief — especially if bearish or dismissive — and the evidence that challenges it, revealing upside.

Relative value assessment: Evaluate whether a genuine mispricing exists between [Company] and its peers. If evidence supports it, construct a long/short pair trade to isolate the specific factor, being explicit that [Company] is the long side. If no compelling mispricing exists, still conclude that the company likely offers a superior risk/reward, but acknowledge the asymmetry is less pronounced. Never force a trade if the data doesn’t support it.

6. SYSTEMIC CONTRADICTIONS & ABSTRACTION LENS
Task: Analyze the provided information (financial statements, text, system descriptions) through a systems-thinking lens to extract non-obvious patterns, systemic contradictions, and counterintuitive insights — with a focus on underappreciated positive feedback loops, hidden strengths, and divergences that signal upside.

Approach: Look for divergences (variables moving in opposite directions) that suggest building momentum, contrast the headline story with underlying structural mechanics that are quietly improving, and identify virtuous cycles or coherences that the market hasn’t fully priced. Also surface underappreciated alignments — where multiple data points converge on a bullish narrative that consensus is ignoring.

Output Formatting Requirements (For this section):

Present the findings as numbered “Insights.”

Give each insight a bold, descriptive headline summarizing the core strategic takeaway.

Back up every claim with specific data points, quotes, or logical proofs directly extracted from the provided source material.

Conclude this section with a concise “Summary of Hidden Patterns” markdown table mapping the specific observation to its broader strategic meaning.

7. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS: AI’S FREE-CHOICE INSIGHT
If — after completing all prior sections — you have identified an additional insight that is not already covered above, present it here. This should be a genuinely material observation that reveals an underappreciated opportunity or strength. You have complete freedom in format and label (give this section a descriptive title that fits the insight). This could be:

A wildcard upside catalyst that no consensus model captures.

A hidden operational or cultural link that explains performance better than financials — and points to continued excellence.

A narrative that connects seemingly unrelated data points into a compelling long thesis.

A description of an unusual pattern you’ve noticed that signals asymmetric upside.
Maintain clarity and bold any key revelations, but beyond that, the structure is yours. If no genuinely non-obvious insight emerges from the data, state that plainly. Do not fabricate novelty or force a contrarian take for its own sake.
